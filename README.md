# Object-Oriented-Modeling-of-Electronic-Circuits
This repository includes all the projects I have done for object-oriented modeling of electronic circuits course at the university of Tehran. In these projects, C++ is used along with SystemC and SystemC-AMS libraries.

# How to Compile
To compile CA1 and CA2, you can compile them like any C++ project. But for the rest of the CAs, a "HowToCompile.txt" file is provided for you.
